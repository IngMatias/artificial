## About
The intersection of web development and artificial intelligence, this project serves as a cohesive blog. Its first dimension introduces content generation automations, streamlining the process of adding standardized blog posts efficiently. The second dimension offers theoretical content, serving as the foundational knowledge for any development in this field.

## This project as WebPage HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django, MathJax
Within this web project, automated scripts are employed to dynamically generate the homepage based on the content within a designated directory where sections as folders are stored and blog entries inside them. The integration process is streamlined, requiring the simple addition of an HTML file to have it seamlessly incorporated into the project.

In addition, a collection of pre-defined CSS classes is at your disposal to style headings, paragraphs, scripts, images, important texts and more. Similarly, CSS classes are utilized to construct the table of contents, encompassing both the table generation, page position indicator, and content navigation.

Furthermore, this project includes the seamless integration of MathJax for rendering LaTeX formulas and the 'highlight' tool for enhanced code presentation. 
It is essential to highlight the utilization of the cloud-based development tool, Replit, which facilitates rapid deployment and production for efficient project management.

## Next Content

### A Math that includes:
Mean, Standard Deviation, Variance, Mode, Medium, Range, Min, Max, Normal Distribution: Mean, Standard Deviation, Variance
Normalization and Standardization: Z-score and mix-max

### Analysis Toolpack

2. Calculo: Media, Varianza, Desvio estandard, Moda, Mediana, Min, Max

### RapidMiner [in progress]
1. Replace Missing Values, Correlation Matrix, Select by Weights, Remove correlated attributes, Weight by Correlation, Detect Outlier(Dis, LOF, Densities, COF) and much more.
2. RM Tutorial could be used in order to get blocks.

### Python [in progress]
1. All necessary for develop study cases as Rapidminer.
2. You can see an advance in PYTHON_ADVANCE.md file. Remember is just an advance it is not well organized and have no explanations.
3. The idea is add not to only add pandas and sklearn examples but also numpy as fundaments of what is happening behind the scenes.

## Next Steps
1. Up to this point, the project has adhered to the fundamentals of machine learning, providing a solid foundation to start with. Clearly, the professional world leans more toward practice than theory, so adding detailed case studies is a necessary enhancement.
2. By introducing case studies, we can incorporate audiovisual content to enhance the overall appeal of the project.
3. One of the more challenging aspects is establishing a unique identity. I've attempted this by adopting a distinctive aesthetic and logo, but I believe there is still much work to be done in this area. Visual appeal is essential for grabbing the user's attention.
4. The inclusion of certifications, such as those available on freeCodeCamp.com, particularly in Data Analysis and Machine Learning, can enhance the attractiveness of the website to potential employers.
